# Implementation of K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm using R and Python

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by a bank with variable descriptions as mentioned below. 

ID: Customer ID,

Age: Customer Age,

Experience: #years of Professional experience,

Income: Annual Income of the customer in $000,

ZIP Code:Home address Zip Code,

Family: Family size of the customer,

CCAvg: Avg spending on credit cards per month in $000,

Education: Education level 1:Undergrad 2: Graduate 3:Advanced/Professional ,

Mortgage: Value of mortgage if any $000,

Securities Account: Does the customer have a securities account with the bank?,

CD Account:Does the customer have a certificate of deposit account with the bank?,

Online : Does the customer use internet banking facilities?,

CreditCard: Does the customer use a credit card issued by the respective bank?,

Personal Loan : Did the customer default on the loan or not ?
 
 ## Project_1
 By using the bank data set we predict the income of the customer based on other independent variables .We estimate the income using KNN 
 regression approach.We check for accuracy of our predictions for various k-values(1,3,5,7) and select the K which gives us the lowest  
 Mean Average Percentage error.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 *Objective* :Classification models using Knn algorithm to predict whether the customer is going to default on loan or not

  *Two implementations of Knn are shown, one using default euclidean distance and the other using value difference measure as a type of      distance measure for categorical variables*
